<h2 style="text-align:center">About</h2>

<br>

<p>
    The sole purpose of this website is to track and analyze Valorant matches played by a single friend group.
    It is meant to mimic the type of dashboard a coach (in any team competition) might use to draw insights.
</p>

<p>
    The inspiration for this site comes from Sports Reference's sports-related websites, 
    such as pro-football-reference.com and basketball-reference.com. Hence the name.
</p>

<p>
    This project was started in an attempt to learn the Python web framework Django. As such, the entire website was
    built with Django.
